<b><li>Fundal Grip-</b> This is the very first step, you need to palpate the upper abdomen to determine the location of the fetal head and buttocks.</li>
<b><li>Lateral Grip-</b> Next is to palpate the sides of the abdomen to feel for the spine and limbs, this could also help you to locate the fetal heart tone</li>
<b><li>Lower Pole-</b> This determines the presenting part of the fetus by palpating the lower abdomen. It helps to determine if the head or the bottom of the fetus is positioned there.</li>
<b>Pelvic Grip-</b> This is the final step that involves the palpating of the pelvis to assess the engagement of the fetal presenting part and estimate its descent into the birth canal</il>
